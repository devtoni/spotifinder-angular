## Spotifinder

### Description

Spotifinder is an app that uses Spotify Api<sup>*</sup> and it is built with AngularJS

It is a mobile design app look like.

For this project I tried to work with .component of AngularJS and ui.router

From 29th May 2017 the spotify API will require an acces token, you can get one in [spotify developer](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications)

Then you only have to change the Token provided in js/services/spotifyService.js
